In industries like manufacturing, power plants, and aviation, equipment failures lead to millions in losses due to unplanned downtime and maintenance. Traditional maintenance strategies, like preventive or reactive maintenance, often fail to optimize costs and do not predict failures in real time. The goal of this project was to build an AI-powered Predictive Maintenance (PdM) system capable of forecasting potential failures before they happen.

📊 Data Pipeline & Feature Engineering
We collected real-time IoT sensor data from industrial machinery, including:

Vibration (V)
Temperature (T)
Humidity (H)
RPM (Rotations Per Minute) (R)
Current & Voltage (I, V)
The dataset had millions of time-series data points, requiring efficient processing. We used:
✅ Apache Spark for distributed ETL
✅ Kafka Streams for real-time data ingestion
✅ Feature Extraction Techniques such as:

RMS (Root Mean Square) for vibration analysis:

Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for frequency-domain analysis
Wavelet Transforms for transient fault detection
🧠 ML Model Development
We explored multiple ML and Deep Learning models to forecast failures:

Anomaly Detection using Autoencoders: Trained an LSTM Autoencoder to detect unusual sensor readings.
Failure Classification (Random Forest & XGBoost):
Target variable: 0 (No Failure) / 1 (Failure Imminent)
F1-score = 92%, Recall = 89%
Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction using LSTM:
Used Survival Analysis with Kaplan-Meier Estimator:

S(t)=P(T>t)=e

The model predicted failures ~7 hours in advance, enabling proactive maintenance scheduling.
🚀 Deployment & Real-World Impact
Deployed using AWS SageMaker with REST API endpoints
Integrated with Edge AI on IoT devices for real-time failure alerts
Reduced unplanned downtime by 35% 🚀
Saved $1.2M annually in operational costs
🎯 Customer Segmentation: AI-Powered Personalization for Business Growth
🔍 Business Challenge
Traditional customer segmentation strategies (e.g., demographics-based) often fail to capture behavioral patterns. Our goal was to build a data-driven segmentation model to boost customer engagement, personalize marketing, and increase revenue.

📊 Data Processing & Engineering
We aggregated data from:
✅ Transactional data (purchase history, frequency, value)
✅ Website analytics (clickstreams, browsing patterns)
✅ Customer support logs

📈 Advanced Clustering & Predictive Analysis
We applied unsupervised learning for segmentation:

K-Means Clustering (Baseline): Identified 4 main customer personas
DBSCAN for outlier detection: Filtered noise from inconsistent behaviors
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for soft clustering: Allowed overlapping customer segments
To refine segmentation, we used RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis:

RFM Score=(0.15×Recency)+(0.28×Frequency)+(0.57×Monetary)
Using Markov Chain Modeling, we predicted customer churn rates and transition probabilities between segments.

🚀 Deployment & Business Impact
Hyper-personalized email marketing → 📈 27% increase in conversions
Churn prevention model → 📉 Reduced customer attrition by 22%
Deployed on Google Cloud AI Platform with real-time dashboards for business analysts</a></li>

🤖 Academic Chatbot: AI-Driven Conversational Assistant for Universities
🔍 The Problem
University students often struggle with course selection, deadlines, and administrative processes. The goal was to build an AI-powered chatbot that:
✅ Provides instant answers to academic queries
✅ Predicts student performance & offers personalized study plans

🧠 AI-Powered NLP Engine
We used Transformer-based models for natural language understanding:

BERT + BiLSTM + CRF → Intent detection & entity recognition
GPT-4 → Dynamic response generation
Neo4j Graph Database → For academic knowledge representation
For predicting student performance, we trained a Reinforcement Learning Model using Markov Decision Processes (MDP):

This helped generate customized study recommendations for students.

🚀 Deployment & Real-World Impact
Automated 85% of university inquiries
Improved student engagement by 40%
Deployed via AWS Lambda & integrated into Microsoft Teams</a></li>
