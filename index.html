        <strong>Problem Statement:</strong> In the realm of medical diagnostics, particularly oncology, the early detection of lung cancer is paramount to improving survival rates. However, traditional diagnostic methods, heavily reliant on radiologists, often face limitations in accuracy and scalability. This is particularly evident in resource-constrained environments where radiologists are overburdened, and time is a critical factor. The challenge lies not just in diagnosis, but in ensuring that the process is both accurate and efficient. The goal of this project was to build an AI-powered system capable of detecting lung cancer at early stages using chest X-rays, thus enhancing diagnostic speed, reliability, and ultimately, saving lives.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Methodology & Technical Framework:</strong> To address this challenge, we turned to deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which have been proven to be highly effective for image classification tasks. Given the complexity of medical imaging, a deep learning model was trained to identify patterns within chest X-rays that would be difficult for the human eye to detect, yet are critical in the early diagnosis of cancer. A key aspect of our approach was leveraging transfer learning. We chose ResNet-50, a pre-trained deep learning architecture, to benefit from its well-established ability to generalize from large-scale image datasets, such as ImageNet. By fine-tuning ResNet-50 on our specialized medical dataset, we could enhance its ability to recognize subtle anomalies in lung X-rays that indicate the presence of tumors.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Project Goals & Objectives:</strong> The overarching goal of the project was to develop a deep learning model capable of detecting lung cancer in chest X-rays with a higher degree of accuracy than current manual methods. We set the following objectives:
        <ul>
          <li>Achieve a model accuracy of over 90% in detecting cancerous nodules.</li>
          <li>Minimize false positives and false negatives, ensuring that both diagnostic speed and reliability were optimized.</li>
          <li>Ensure the model could be deployed efficiently in real-time clinical settings, offering support to radiologists without disrupting existing workflows.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>End-to-End Process:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Data Collection & Preprocessing: The dataset consisted of over 50,000 labeled chest X-ray images sourced from multiple hospitals, ensuring diversity in terms of patient demographics and imaging conditions. The data was resized and normalized for model training.</li>
          <li>Model Selection & Training: ResNet-50 was chosen for its deep residual learning capabilities. The model was trained with the Adam optimizer, with early stopping to prevent overfitting.</li>
          <li>Hyperparameter Tuning & Model Evaluation: A grid search method and cross-validation were used for tuning hyperparameters, and the final model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</li>
          <li>Deployment & Integration: The model was deployed on a cloud platform using TensorFlow Serving, integrated with a web-based front end for real-time clinical use via an API.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Results & Impact:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Accuracy: 92%</li>
          <li>Precision: 91%</li>
          <li>Recall: 93%</li>
          <li>F1-Score: 92%</li>
          <li>Diagnostic Time Reduction: 30%</li>
          <li>Model Integration: Seamless with existing hospital infrastructure, providing real-time predictions.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Lessons Learned & Future Scope:</strong> Data quality remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, and while our model performed well on the dataset used, future work will involve expanding the dataset to include more diverse imaging conditions and patients from different geographical regions. Additionally, exploring multi-modal data (combining imaging with patient history) could enhance diagnostic precision even further. Looking ahead, the next phase will focus on scaling the model to include detection for other types of cancers and improving the modelâ€™s robustness in real-world, non-ideal conditions, such as images taken with low-quality equipment.
